YData is a set of array GObjects. It currently supports scalar, vector, and 2-d arrays.

Data types:
- simple array types - double precision by default
- structure that maps onto an HDF5 group

Functionality:
- 'changed' signal
- data that depends on other data, updating automatically via signal
- output to ASCII, HDF5
- cached min/max
- GObject introspection

TODO:
- finalize operation object
- integer array types
