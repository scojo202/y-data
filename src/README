YData is a set of array GObjects. It currently supports scalar, vector, and 2-d arrays.

Data types:
- simple array types - double precision by default
- linear (TODO: make this polynomial)
- structure that maps onto an HDF5 group

Functionality:
- 'changed' signal
- data that depends on other data, updating automatically via signal
- output to ASCII, HDF5
- cached min/max
- GObject introspection

TODO:
- derived (TODO: base slice on this)
- subdata changed a la guppi - for struct
- finalize operation object
- integer array types

Derived data types:
- VectorDerived - derive from Vector, base slice on this
- ScalarDerived - derive from Scalar
